# /agents:doctor — Workspace Health Review

You audit the agent workspace and say what to fix first. You **never change a file**. The owning agent does the fixing; you hand the principal the exact command to start it.

Thresholds below mirror the master conventions (`agents/CONVENTIONS.md` § Tracker Hygiene, § Memory, § Baseline Consolidation). Do not read the master for this; the numbers are here.

## Workspace Detection

Glob for both `agents/*/context.md` (single-domain) and `agents/*/*/context.md` (multi-domain, grouped by scope), relative to the current working directory. Use whichever matches, or both if mixed. Directory names match case-insensitively.

`$ARGUMENTS`: empty = every active agent. `<name>` = one agent (deep report). `<scope>` = that scope. `all` = include retired agents.

**Retired agents** (`status: retired` in `context.md` frontmatter) are skipped unless `all`. Only check that their files still exist.

## Checks

Run `date` first. For every agent in scope, run `wc -c` on the files below in one call (glob the paths, then one `wc -c` per agent). Read files only where a check needs content; use Grep where a pattern is enough.

### A. Startup cost (what the agent reads before it says hello)

Sum the bytes of: workspace `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` + the master it extends (count once per report; the master is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/template/agents/CONVENTIONS.md`, or glob `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/agents/*/template/agents/CONVENTIONS.md` highest version, or `.claude/skills/agents/../..` in copied mode — if unresolvable, use 27,000), `soul.md`, `name.md`, `role.md`, `autonomy.md`, `agents/tools/INDEX.md`, `tools.md`, `actions.md`, `MEMORY.md`, every file in `memory/standing/`, the 2 newest files in `memory/sessions/`, `context.md`, and every path listed under its `## Startup Context`. Estimate tokens as bytes ÷ 4.

| Tokens | Grade |
|--------|-------|
| ≤ 25k | ✅ |
| 25k–50k | ⚠️ |
| > 50k | ❌ |

Always name the **single biggest file** and its share. That is the fix.

### B. Tracker (`actions.md`)

- ❌ missing file.
- ❌ file > 40 KB; ⚠️ > 20 KB.
- ❌ the `Last reviewed:` line is longer than 600 characters, or contains "Prior review" more than once. Session narrative has been stuffed into the header; it belongs in `memory/sessions/` (one file per session) with the header cut to one line.
- ⚠️ no `Last reviewed:` line; ⚠️ its date is > 14 days old; ❌ > 45 days old.
- ⚠️ Open section has no `### P1` / `### P2` / `### P3` sub-sections.
- ⚠️ more than 8 open P1 rows (count table rows under `### P1` before the next heading).
- ⚠️ Open contains struck-through rows (`~~`).
- ⚠️ Completed table has rows dated more than 30 days ago and `actions-archive.md` exists (they should be archived); ⚠️ `actions-archive.md` missing.
- ⚠️ any row whose Status cell says blocked / gated / awaiting for more than 30 days (compare the row's date if it has one; otherwise skip).

### C. Memory

- ❌ more than 5 files in `memory/standing/` or more than 10 in `memory/sessions/` (consolidation is overdue: master § Baseline Consolidation).
- ❌ any single file in `memory/standing/` > 15 KB (data dump in standing memory; belongs under `work/` or `knowledge/` with a one-page summary).
- ⚠️ `MEMORY.md` > 6 KB.
- ⚠️ `MEMORY.md` links (`[[name]]` or `memory/...` paths) that match no file in `memory/**` (grep the names, glob for them).
- ⚠️ newest file in `memory/sessions/` older than the tracker's `Last reviewed` date by more than 7 days (sessions ran without a memory entry).

### D. Files and wiring

- ❌ any of these missing: `role.md`, `soul.md`, `name.md`, `autonomy.md`, `tools.md`, `actions.md`, `context.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `memory/standing/`, `memory/sessions/`.
- ❌ a path under `## Startup Context` in `context.md` that does not exist.
- ⚠️ `memory/scheduled/inbox.md` exists and has `UNPROCESSED` entries (count them).
- ⚠️ `peer/` has more than 10 files, or any file with `status: open` older than 7 days (a peer request nobody answered).
- ⚠️ a playbook (`playbooks/*.md`) has no `## Trigger` section. ℹ️ `playbooks/` is empty (normal for a new agent; mention once, no fix needed).
- ℹ️ active agent whose `Last reviewed` is > 60 days old: suggest retiring it (`status: retired` in `context.md`).

### E. Workspace level (once per report)

- ❌ `agents/CONVENTIONS.md` missing or without `extends:` in frontmatter.
- ⚠️ `reserved:` list in that frontmatter does not match the agent directories (names missing from the list, or listed names with no directory).
- ⚠️ `agents/tools/INDEX.md` missing.
- ⚠️ `CLAUDE.md` `## Agents` table lists an agent that is retired or missing, or omits an active one.
- ℹ️ `git status --short agents/` shows uncommitted changes (list the count only).
- ❌ (Herdr only: run `echo "$HERDR_ENV"`; if `1`) `herdr agent list` shows the same agent name live in two or more panes whose `cwd` is under this root — two sessions share one tracker. Name the panes. Ignore other roots.

## Output

Heading: `# Agent Workspace Health — <today's date>` (no hardcoded project name).

1. **Scorecard** — one row per agent, single-line cells, `|` replaced with `·`:

   | Agent | Startup | Tracker | Memory | Files | Top issue |
   |-------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-----------|

   Startup shows the token estimate and grade, e.g. `44k ⚠️`. The other columns show the worst grade in that group. Top issue is ≤ 10 words. Add a Scope column only if more than one scope exists.

2. **Findings** — ❌ first, then ⚠️, then ℹ️. One line each: `❌ Balbus — actions.md is 93 KB; the Last reviewed line holds ~80 KB of nested session narrative.` Group by agent. Skip checks that passed; do not pad.

3. **Do this next** — at most 3 items, highest leverage first. Each names the agent, the fix in one sentence, and the exact command to start it, e.g.:
   - `/agents:start Balbus tracker cleanup — cut the Last reviewed line to one sentence and move the history into session memories`
   - `/agents:start Cato consolidate memory`
   - `/agents:new` is never a doctor recommendation; `/agents:init` only if E fails.

4. If everything passes: say so in one line and stop.

**Deep report** (`/agents:doctor <name>`): same layout for one agent, plus a table of every startup file with bytes and share, largest first.

Do not fix anything. Do not commit.
